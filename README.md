Plasmawatch is an Overwatch 1 Private Server recreation project. This is the patcher and launcher for the project.

Written in C++.

## Usage
`OverLauncher "path in quotes"`
(You need quotes or it will not load, blame how strings work in c++ than me please)

Example: `OverLauncher.exe "D:\t\Overwatch 1\Overwatch Beta 0.8.0.24919\GameClientApp.exe"`

### Note
This is like really bad so I would 100% advise someone else to make a 3rd party launcher just using the patcher code.
